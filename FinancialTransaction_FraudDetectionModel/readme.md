#1. Business Understanding

##1.1. Overview
This comprehensive financial dataset combines transaction records, customer information, and card data from a banking institution, spanning across the 2010s decade.

##1.2. Dataset

ðŸ’³ Financial Transactions Dataset: Analytics

Links to an external site.

5 datasets will be analyzed: Primarly for Fraud analysis and detection model

- transactions_data.csv: Main transaction records
- cards_data.csv: Credit/debit card details
- users_data.csv: User/customer demographic data
- mcc_codes.json: Merchant category classification
- train_fraud_labels.json:
    
-- Binary fraud labels for transactions (target),
-- Indicates fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions
-- Ideal for training supervised fraud detection models

Each dataset contributes to building a holistic feature set for fraud detection.

##1.3. Business Context

The primary objective of this dataset is to facilitate the development and evaluation of machine learning models aimed at detecting fraudulent financial transactions

The goal of this project is to predict whether a given financial transaction is fraudulent or not, based on historical transaction data provided in the dataset.

    In financial systems, fraud detection is critical to prevent monetary loss, protect customers, and maintain trust in payment platforms.

    Early and accurate detection of fraud reduces financial risks and operational costs for banks, fintech companies, and e-commerce platforms.

    Build a binary classification model that, given a new transactionâ€™s features (such as amount, timestamp, transaction type, etc.), predicts the likelihood that it is fraudulent(Fraud or Not Fraud)
