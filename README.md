## Practical Application1 <Will the Customer Accept the Coupon>
### Context
A coupon is delivered to your cell phone for a restaurant near where you are driving
### Business Problem Statement

- Would you accept that coupon and take a short detour to the restaurant? 
- Would you accept the coupon but use it on a subsequent trip? 
- Would you ignore the coupon entirely? 
- What if the coupon was for a bar instead of a restaurant? What about a coffee house? 
- Would you accept a bar coupon with a minor passenger in the car? 
- What about if it was just you and your partner in the car? 
- Would weather impact the rate of acceptance? What about the time of day?
