## Practical Application1 <Will the Customer Accept the Coupon>
### Context
A coupon is delivered to driver cell phone for a restaurant near where you are driving.

### Business Problem Statement

#### Consumer <Coupon>
- Would driver accept that coupon and take a short detour to the restaurant? 
- Would driver accept the coupon but use it on a subsequent trip? 
- Would driver ignore the coupon entirely? 
- What if the coupon was for a bar instead of a restaurant? What about a coffee house? 
- Would driver accept a bar coupon with a minor passenger in the car? 
- What about if it was just dirver and driver partner in the car? 
- Would weather impact the rate of acceptance? What about the time of day?

#### Business
- Whether the coupon is delivered to the driver or not, 
- What are the factors that determine whether a driver accepts the coupon once it is delivered to them? 
- How would business determine whether a driver is likely to accept a coupon

### Project Goal
- visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.
